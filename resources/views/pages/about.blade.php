                    regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in
                    litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

            </ul>

            <p><strong><u><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></u></strong></p>

            <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.&nbsp;,&nbsp;express consent)
                to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be
                inferred (i.e.&nbsp;,&nbsp;implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click&nbsp;<a

            <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information
                without your consent, including, for example:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely
                    way</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

                    an insurance claim</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the
                    accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
                    breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

            <p><strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>

            <p><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system

                designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
                efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
                technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
                cybercriminals, or other&nbsp;unauthorized&nbsp;third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
                improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your
                personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You

                    under 18 years of age&nbsp;.</em></p>

            <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you

                18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
                delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
                age 18, please contact us at&nbsp;info@wathik.app&nbsp;.</p>

            <p><strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>

            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                (&nbsp;&quot;DNT&quot;&nbsp;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
                have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
                standard for&nbsp;recognizing&nbsp;and implementing DNT signals has been&nbsp;finalized&nbsp;. As such, we
                do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
                future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

            <p>In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is

            <p><u>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer&rsquo;s Privacy Rights</u></p>

            <p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>

            <p>We do not process consumer&#39;s sensitive personal information.</p>

            <p><u>Verification process</u></p>

            <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about
                whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
                information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance,
                depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can
                match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you
                through a communication method (e.g.&nbsp;,&nbsp;phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We
                may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

            <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make
                the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
                purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained
                by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity
                and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon
                as we finish verifying you.</p>

            <p><u>Other privacy rights</u></p>

            <ul>
                <li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to
                    restrict the processing of the information.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>You can designate an&nbsp;authorized&nbsp;agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may
                    deny a request from an&nbsp;authorized&nbsp;agent that does not submit proof that they have been
                    validly&nbsp;authorized&nbsp;to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third parties.
                    Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no
                    later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.</li>
